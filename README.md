  This project is dedicated to enhancing security and combating credit card fraud through the utilization of various Machine Learning models. Our goal is to provide a robust solution that safeguards financial transactions from fraudulent activities.

### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a set of Machine Learning models that can **effectively detect and prevent credit card fraud**. By implementing state-of-the-art algorithms, data preprocessing techniques, and ensembling methods, we strive to achieve the highest possible accuracy in identifying fraudulent transactions and thereby enhancing security in financial transactions.

### Features
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We have performed thorough exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset, enabling us to understand the distribution of fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

Balanced Dataset: To mitigate the impact of class imbalance, we've employed both **Undersampling and SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** techniques to achieve a balanced dataset. This enhances the performance of our models by ensuring they are not biased towards the majority class.

Machine Learning Models: Our approach involves implementing a variety of classifiers, including **Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, K Nearest Neighbour, and Decision Tree**. These models serve as the foundation for detecting fraudulent transactions.

Ensemble Techniques: To further improve our models, we've employed ensemble techniques such as **AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost**. These techniques leverage the collective power of multiple models to achieve the best possible F1 score, **XGBoost achieves the best score among all**, which is critical for accurate fraud detection.
